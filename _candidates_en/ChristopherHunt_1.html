<p>Thereâ€™s been too much talk and not enough code when it comes to microservices. This talk corrects that by illustrating some patterns when crafting real microservices and features a live demonstration of deploying and managing them. The Reactive Manifesto is applied along with Scala, Akka and Play.</p>
